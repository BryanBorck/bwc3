# GoodStream - BWC3 Hackathon 2023

_Built with Celo Superfluid and GoodDollar_

## Introduction

GoodStream is a web app designed to leverage donations to communities. Using superfluid, we provide a way to make an exchange of use time in money donated and using Good Dollar, we can donate money to support communities. Our goal is to make a whole ecossystem to provide knowledge and support basic income to a lot of people using Good Dollar.

## Problem & Solution

Our idea came from a true story of a friend of ours:

> He needed money, around 20 thousand dollars, to attend a one-semester course at MIT. Here in Brazil, we have crowdfunding platforms, but even so, the amount was high, and it seemed impossible to reach the goal. 

> Then, an idea emerged. He had contacts with friends who were leaders in some of the country's largest companies, so he realized that it would be a great way to raise money if he organized an event and could invite the experts he knew to give free lectures, selling tickets to raise funds.

> It was an experience that turned out to be very successful. After all, it was just an hour in the life of a company leader that was donated and could be converted into revenue of 10 thousand BRL for people who wanted to learn more. It was turning time into money through donation.

So, we thought about it and asked ourselves: 

**Why not create a platform where people could donate their time through sharing their expertise, and others could learn while donating money?** 

It seems like something magical, _where everyone comes out a winner_, and in the end, we can raise a fundraising fund to help communities in need of financial support.

We think our only initial problem is to make a great marketing around the idea, but it has a great potential to transform lives around the world, and we think the use of Superfluid and GoodDollar has a perfect harmony to build the app.

## Features
